# BadUSB
Arduino scripts for BadUSB attacks (Teensy/Digispark)
 - All scripts targeted to Windows hosts here generally use the IEX method to quickly load powershell scripts in memory.
 - Most if not ALL of these scripts are referenced from my "offensive-scripts" repo: https://github.com/timebotdon/offensive-scripts

## WifiRecon (Teensy/DigiSpark)
 - Grabs Wifi Passwords and dumps them to a text file on the victim's desktop.
 - Uses https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timebotdon/offensive-scripts/master/Windows/wifirecon.ps1 to grab Wifi Passwords.
